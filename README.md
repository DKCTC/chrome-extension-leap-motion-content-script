# chrome-extension-leap-motion-content-script
Script for defining gesture controls in content scripts using the Leap Motion controller, requires the Leap Motion JavaScript library

https://www.leapmotion.com/

Full documentation coming soon! For now, there are js files with some samples in them. There are also notes in the code itself.

Adds gesture control for scrolling the window (main hand, palm up, fist closed) and moving a motion cursor around the window and keytapping when enabled (non-main hand). Also has functions for defining custom gestures and callbacks, including those available in the Leap Motion library.
